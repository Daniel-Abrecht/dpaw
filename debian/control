Package: libdpaw-wm0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: dpaw
Description: convenience library for interacting with dpaw-wm
 Other applications may want to let the dpaw window manager do
 certain things, like showing the onscreen keyboard, for example.
 This library offers methods to make that easier. It isn't strictly
 necessary for that, though. Most things can be done manually by
 setting an X11 property or by sending X11 ClientMessages as well.
